There is a trend now to create an image (attached) with this prompt: Present a clear, 45° top-down isometric miniature 3D cartoon scene of [CITY], featuring its most iconic landmarks and architectural elements. Use soft, refined textures with realistic PBR materials and gentle, lifelike lighting and shadows. Integrate the current weather conditions directly into the city environment to create an immersive atmospheric mood.
Use a clean, minimalistic composition with a soft, solid-colored background.

At the top-center, place the title “[CITY]” in large bold text, a prominent weather icon beneath it, then the date (small text) and temperature (medium text).
All text must be centered with consistent spacing, and may subtly overlap the tops of the buildings.
Square 1080x1080 dimension.

So I want to create a multiple or one account that every day will post an image of spesipic or multiple places. Daily.

In Instagram and X, so we need to create an automation that will fetch the weather to dynamic city and he will create my prompt with Nano Banana, then posting this to those both account.

Build me a working plan so I just open those account and put the api keys and it's working.

If you have unanswered questions that you can decide on your own, ask me.

Other then that, try to build that project with the best tools available, Until Today.

I want to create a multiple account that each will create for one city. 

I'll post once or twice a day. Time zone will decide based on the city, in general make everything dynamic to change, like liat of city's to each account, or how much time a day, a month and so. So it will be easy to add more action in the middle. 

So lets do go with OpenWeatherMap and GitHub action, and all the rest. Let's Aim for tiktok too.
